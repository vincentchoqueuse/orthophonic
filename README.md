# ðŸŽµ Orthophonic

**Orthophonic** is a research-based Python library for algorithmic music composition, leveraging mathematical principles such as **zero-crossings of oscillators, non-uniform sampling, and structured event distributions**. By bridging signal processing and musical structures, Orthophonic provides a framework for generating rhythms, pitch scales, and musical sequences based on rigorous mathematical foundations.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Mathematically-driven composition**: Generates musical structures using **oscillator zero-crossings** and **event spacing optimization**.
- **Harmonic & Rhythmic Generation**: Supports **equal temperament**, **custom scales**, and **rhythmic patterns**.
- **Grid-Based Event Placement**: Uses a **master grid** for time and frequency structuring.
- **Customizable Phase & Frequency Modulation**: Enables fine control over rhythm and pitch via local oscillators.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with **Ableton Live, Max/MSP, SuperCollider**, and other DAWs.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

> Work with python 3.12

To install Orthophonic, simply run:


```bash
